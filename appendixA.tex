Something about the previous scattering results...  most likely due to L1 cache being removed in Kepler (L1 is local, not cached, Fermi had a L1)

Figure \ref{prelim_speedup_old} shows the speedup factors, $F_s=t_\mathrm{CPU}/t_\mathrm{GPU}$, of the GPU implementations discussed in Section \ref{sec:prelim}.  This benchmark was run on the same server with a 8-core AMD Opteron 6128 CPU clocked at 2.0GHz, but on a Tesla C2075 card.  The task-parallel implementation performs best, with a maximum speedup of around 29x.  The remapping implementation has the next best performance, with about a 20x speedup over the CPU. The batched implementation's performance departs from the remapping implementation at $10^5$ particles and even starts to deteriorate between $10^6$ and $10^7$ particles.  This is due to the transport having to be done in batches at this point due to the maximum block number of 65,536.
