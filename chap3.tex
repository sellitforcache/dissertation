\chapter{GPU Implementation}

typical task-based MC.  data-parallel MC - wide but single task, homework grading, weaving!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Data Layout}

brief introduction, not using S(a,b) or unresolved resonance parameters at this point

\subsubsection{unionized}

unionized glory, why its good and bad \cite{jaakko}.

\subsubsection{linked lists}

how to resolve the data heterogeny problem

\subsection{Embedded Python}

PyNE

amazing Python C API

\subsection{Pseudo-Random Numbers}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tasks}

breakdown of tasks into sub-tasks, actually going through how data is stored, accessed, etc

\subsection{Grid Search}

binary search here? more logN?  quad tree?

\subsection{Geometry Representation}

stuff about geom and "where am I?"

\subsubsection{OptiX}

\subsubsection{Acceleration Structures}

Importance of logN


\subsubsection{Point-in-Polygon / Gauss's Law / Divergence Thoerem}

Roll the where am I into  trace

cellular geometry as opposed to combinatorial


\subsubsection{Scaling}

optix scaling toy problem - need to have very large sets in order to hide overhead


\subsection{Macroscopic}

material

\subsection{Microscopic}

nuclide

\subsection{Interactions}

\subsubsection{Scattering}

Rodriguez rotation

\subsubsection{Secondary-Producing}

\subsubsection{Disappearance}

\subsubsection{Concurrent Kernels}

\subsection{Parallel Operations}

CUDPP, reductions, sums, and sorts - sorting by reaction to keep warps full, memory implications

\subsubsection{Fixed source subcritical multiplication}

necessary to be subcritical.

pop can pop source particles in to keep population constant until NPS exceeded...

\subsubsection{Criticality}

cannot simply pop, unless generation number is associated, then data can be generated and post-processed?

need to do generations since the source update is generation-dependent, can this be changed?
