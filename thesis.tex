\begin{acknowledgements}

 I would like to thank all my committee members for the time and effort they put into my progression through candidacy.  I would especially like to thank my advisor, Jasmina Vuji{\'c}, for the opportunities she has given me as a student, and whose generosity and inclusiveness has made my experience at UC Berkeley the most personally and intellectually enriching period in my life. 

I would also like to thank Jaakko Lepp{\"a}nen for his willingness to share his wealth of knowledge and helping me when I was stumped, Katy Huff for her lightning fast emails while helping me with programming issues, PyNE and its development team for making my life easier, and OpenMC and its development team for trailblazing open source Monte Carlo neutron transport and their clearly written source code and documentation.	  

I couldn't have survived without Maya Mathura and I am grateful for all the love, patience, and support she continually shows me.  To my family, you are the reason I succeed, thank you for your unwavering support of my endeavors.
