\begin{acknowledgements}

 I would like to thank my committee members for the time and effort they all put into [getting me graduated]
 
 want to thank Greenspan for XXX,  I want to thank Per, Per, and Rachel for agreeing to be on my committee  
  
 I especially like to thank my advisor, Jasmina Vuji{\"c}.  Her generosity has made my experience at Berkeley one of the most personally and intellectually enriching 
 	 so amazing, serbs, travel, etc.

I would also like to thank Jaakko Lepp{\"a}nen for his wealth of knowledge and willingness to help, Katy Huff for being a CS sounding board and lightning fast emails, PyNE and its development team for making my life easier, and OpenMC and its development team for trailblazing open source Monte Carlo neutron transport and for their clearly written code and great documentation.	  

Lat and not least, I want to thank Maya Mathura and my family for all the love, patience, and support you've shown me.  You're the rock I stand on.
